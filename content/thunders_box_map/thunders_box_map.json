This also goes to creator name, though it can be implied it's <i>\"Thunder\"</i> or similar. Reach out on the GitHub repository for this to be updated, if this is you.<br><br>Thunder's Box is a two window box map with five Perk-A-Colas available (Quick Revive, Jugger-Nog, Speed Cola, Double Tap Root Beer, Stamin-Up, and a cheeky PhD Flopper troll), with more aggressive Zombies than the base game. It has an edgy sense of humor, but not edgy enough to be a real problem. Definitely a tough one.<br><br>High round records are tracked at a World Record site <a href=\"https://zwr.gg/leaderboards/custom/custom-box-map/thunders-box/\">here</a>.",
